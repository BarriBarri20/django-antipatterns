# django-antipatterns

A repository documenting anti-patterns often found in Django projects.

The antipatterns each explain the problem, why it is a problem, and what can be
done to mitigate the problem.

The rendered version of the (anti)patterns can be found at at the [GitHub pages](https://hapytex.github.io/django-antipatterns/)

You can contribute by writing an anti-pattern yourself and making a pull request
to add it to this repository.

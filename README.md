A repository documenting anti-patterns often found in Django projects.

The antipatterns each explain the problem, why it is a problem, and what can be
done to mitigate the problem.

The rendered version of the (anti)patterns can be found at at [django-antipatterns.com](http://www.django-antipatterns.com/).
